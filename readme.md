# Designing Our Flashcard Game in Scratch üéÆüìö

**Welcome to your coding adventure!** You‚Äôll experience how software developers build real apps‚Äîscrum, MVPs, and all‚Äîwhile having fun with flashcards. You‚Äôll need a **sponsors** (a teacher) to try out your game and give feedback. We work in **three sprints** (1 week each). You can code solo or with a buddy! ü§ñ‚ú®

**Prerequisites:** Basic familiarity with Scratch‚Äîknowing how to create sprites, lists, variables, and use broadcast messages and event handlers.



## User Stories üìù

1. **Teacher Admin**: ‚ÄúI want to add word pairs by week using a simple input interface before students play, then lock access so no further edits are possible during gameplay.‚Äù üîí
2. **Student Player**: ‚ÄúI want to pick a week and practice the flashcards to learn English!‚Äù üåü
3. **Student Player**: ‚ÄúI want to add word pairs by week using a simple input interface before students play, then lock access so no further edits are possible during gameplay.‚Äù üîä

*These stories form our **scope** and define the features (MVP‚ÄîMinimum Viable Product).*

* **Data Store:** Maintains all lists and variables.
* **Control Logic:** Implements user stories via broadcast messages and handlers.
* **UI Sprites:** Separate sprites handle user input (buttons) and output (card display, audio).

## Data Model  üóÇÔ∏è
Define the core data structures that represent the application‚Äôs state:

| Entity         | Type             | Description                                             |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EnglishWeekN` | List of strings  | English vocabulary for week N                           |
| `SwedishWeekN` | List of strings  | Swedish equivalents for week N                          |
| `CurrentWeek`  | Integer variable | Index of the active week (1‚Ä¶N)                          |
| `CardIndex`    | Integer variable | Index within the selected week‚Äôs list                   |
| `FrontSide`    | String variable  | Text shown on the front of the flashcard                |
| `BackSide`     | String variable  | Text shown on the back of the flashcard                 |
| `IsLocked`     | Boolean variable | Flag indicating whether administrator input is disabled |

A well-defined data model serves as a blueprint; changing variable names or list structures mid-project can introduce errors across all scripts.

> **Hint (KISS & DRY)**: Keep names clear (no `E1`/`S1`) so you don‚Äôt confuse lists. DRY = Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself; reuse variables instead of new ones for each week.



## Mapping User Stories ‚Üí Modules üöÄ

| User Story                 | Module/Sprite          | Functionality                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Teacher adds & locks cards | **Admin** sprite       | "ask‚Ä¶" blocks populate lists until `IsLocked=1`                                                  |
| Choose week & load a card  | **WeekButton** sprites | set `CurrentWeek`, broadcast `LoadCard`                                                          |
| Show & flip card           | **Card** sprite        | on `LoadCard`: pick random `CardIndex`, show `FrontSide`; on click: show `BackSide` + play sound |
| Hear pronunciations        | **Card** sprite        | `play sound [word_EN]` / `play sound [word_SE]`                                                  |
| Next card                  | **NextButton** sprite  | broadcast `LoadCard`                                                                             |

Assigning each user story to a distinct module increases **separation of concerns**, simplifying debugging and future enhancements.




## Implementation Steps in Scratch üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Set up Data** (like defining your DB tables):
   * Create lists: `EnglishWeek1‚Ä¶EnglishWeekN`, `SwedishWeek1‚Ä¶SwedishWeekN`
   * Create variables: `CurrentWeek`, `CardIndex`, `FrontSide`, `BackSide`, `IsLocked`
1.  **Admin Mode**:
   * In Admin sprite: on green-flag ‚Üí `set IsLocked to 0`.
   * If `IsLocked=0`, `ask [Week?]`, `ask [English?]`, `ask [Swedish?]`, add answers to correct lists.
1. **Lock Admin**:
   * Teacher clicks a custom button or script to `set IsLocked to 1`.
1. **Week Buttons**:
   * Each WeekX button: on click ‚Üí `set CurrentWeek to X` ‚Üí broadcast `LoadCard`.
1. **Card Sprite**:
   * On `LoadCard`:
     * `set CardIndex to pick random 1 to length of EnglishWeek(CurrentWeek)`
     * `set FrontSide to item CardIndex of EnglishWeek(CurrentWeek)`
     * `set BackSide to item CardIndex of SwedishWeek(CurrentWeek)`
     * `say FrontSide`
   * On click:
     * `play sound [FrontSide_EN]`; `say BackSide`; `play sound [BackSide_SE]`
1. **Next Button**:
   * On click ‚Üí broadcast `LoadCard`
1. **Test & Iterate**:
   * Run each module (Admin, Load, Flip) separately; fix bugs; refine UI positions.





 


## Three‚ÄëWeek Plan ‚è±Ô∏è

You can complete this project in **three weeks**, spending **a few‚ÄØhours** each week. After each week‚Äôs work, your sponsor (teacher or mentor) will test your game to make sure everything works and give you feedback.
| Week | Activities |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Set up lists & variables; Build the Admin input interface and add a few sample words; Sponsor tests data entry and lock feature |
| 2    | Create buttons to select weeks; Implement loading a card and flipping from front to back; Add pronunciation sounds; Sponsor checks game flow |
| 3    | Add the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button to advance cards; Finalize the lock mechanism so no more edits can occur during play; Polish the user interface layout; Sponsor conducts final playtest and approval |

*At the end of each week, a quick demo to your sponsor helps catch issues early and makes your game stronger!*



# Engineering Hints & Self-Learning Tips üîç

* **Scratch & Community**: Check Scratch‚Äôs built-in docs (Help ‚Üí About Blocks) or the Scratch Wiki.
* **YouTube & Google**: Search "Scratch flashcard tutorial" or "Scratch get random item" for example projects.
* **Rubber Duck Debugging**: Explain your script to a buddy or even a stuffed toy! Bugs often vanish when you talk through them.
* **Refactor Early**: If your code feels messy, pause and reorganize sprites or variable names‚Äîclean code is happy code!
* **Separation of Concerns:** Keep data-loading logic separate from UI logic. Changes in one module should not break another.
* **Consistent Naming:** Use descriptive names (e.g., `EnglishWeek1` rather than `EW1`) to avoid confusion when referencing lists in scripts.
* **Modularity:** Encapsulate each feature (admin, week select, card display) in its own sprite to support independent testing and future extension.
* **Error Handling:** Consider adding feedback (e.g., `say "No cards available"`) if a list is empty or `IsLocked = true` when trying to add cards.
